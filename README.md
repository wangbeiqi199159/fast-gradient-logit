# Fast Gradient Ridge Logistic Regression

Ridge logistic regression is one of common regularized regressions, which is also called l2 logistic regression. The problem writes as:

## Demo

There are three demo files:

`demo on simulated dataset.ipynb` allows a user to launch the method on a simple simulated dataset,
visualize the training process, and print the performance. Data source and information is included in the demo file.

`demo on real world dataset.ipynb` allows a user to launch the method on a real-world dataset of your
choice, visualize the training process, and print the performance. Data source and information is included in the demo file.

`Experimental Comparison to Sklearn.ipynb` allows a user to compare result of this package with scikit-learn. Data source and information is included in the demo file.
